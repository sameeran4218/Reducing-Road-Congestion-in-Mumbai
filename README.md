# Reducing Road Congestion in Mumbai

## Background
The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) is grappling with severe road congestion
problems, which are adversely impacting the quality of life for residents and the city's economic
efficiency. This congestion leads to longer travel times, increased pollution, and higher stress
levels among commuters. Moreover, it hinders the smooth movement of goods and services,
thereby affecting businesses and the overall economy. To address these pressing issues,
MCGM has engaged consultants to carry out a thorough study. The objective is to develop a
detailed report that not only analyzes the current state of road congestion but also provides
actionable recommendations. These recommendations will encompass both short-term
measures to provide immediate relief and long-term strategies to ensure sustainable
improvement in traffic flow and urban mobility. The study aims to create a more efficient,
accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation system for Greater Mumbai.

## Key Considerations
- To analyze the current state of road congestion in Greater Mumbai.
- To propose actionable recommendations to alleviate congestion through both
supply-side and demand-side interventions.
- To explore innovative solutions for future implementation, such as dynamic congestion
pricing, new modes of transport, etc.

## Deliverables
This study delivers a comprehensive analysis of Greater Mumbai's road congestion
issues, focusing on both road infrastructure and public transport systems. It provides
recommendations for short-term and long-term interventions to improve road quality, enhance
public transport, and promote non-motorized transport options. The study proposes
innovative solutions such as dynamic congestion pricing and strategies to encourage
carpooling. Additionally, it outlines potential risks and suggest measures to ensure
equitable access to transportation and public acceptance of proposed changes.
